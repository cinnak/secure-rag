# SecureRAG Project Status

**Date:** April 7, 2025 *(Updated)*

## Goal

To build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain that enforces data access control based on user permissions (roles: Engineer, HR, PM). The system should only retrieve and generate answers based on documents the user is authorized to access, leveraging Google AI (Gemini) models.

## Original Plan & Progress

### MVP Feature Scope

- [x] User Login & Permission Simulation (Conceptual roles defined: Engineer, HR, PM)
- [x] Upload/Define Different Permission Documents (Sample `docs.json` created with permissions)
- [x] Permission-Based QA Retrieval Logic (Implemented in `PermissionRetriever`)
- [x] LangChain Module Integration:
    - [x] Document Loading & Chunking (`app/indexing.py`)
    - [x] Embedding + Vector DB (`app/indexing.py` using Google Embeddings + FAISS)
    - [x] Retriever + Custom Filtering (`app/retriever.py`)
    - [x] ChatModel Invocation (`app/rag_chain.py` using Gemini)
- [x] Simple Web UI (Streamlit `ui/interface.py` created and tested)

### Two-Week Development Plan (Estimated Progress)

- [x] **Day 1:** Requirements Clarification + Data Prep + Role Setting
- [x] **Day 2-3:** Document Load + Chunking + Vectorization + DB Creation (`app/indexing.py`)
- [x] **Day 4:** Build Permission Retriever (`app/retriever.py`, `tests/test_retriever.py`)
- [x] **Day 5:** QA Interface Logic + Prompt Template + Safety (`app/rag_chain.py`, `tests/test_rag_chain.py`)
- [x] **Day 6-7:** Simple Login Simulation + Frontend UI (`ui/interface.py`)
- [x] **Day 8:** Integration Testing (Completed via UI)
- [ ] **Day 9-10:** Project Documentation + README 

## Current Status Summary

The core backend logic and the Streamlit UI for permission-aware RAG are implemented and successfully tested end-to-end. Key components (`app/indexing.py`, `app/retriever.py`, `app/rag_chain.py`, `ui/interface.py`) and their corresponding tests (`tests/test_retriever.py`, `tests/test_rag_chain.py`, manual UI testing) confirm functionality. The system correctly generates permission-filtered answers using the specified Gemini model (`gemini-1.0-pro` or similar) and FAISS vector store, accessible via the UI. API key management via `.env` is working.

## Next Steps (Focus: Day 9-10)

1.  **Finalize Documentation:**
    * Review and update `README.md`.
    * Review and update this `PROJECT_STATUS.md` file.
    * Ensure comments in code are clear and sufficient.
    * Verify `requirements.txt` is accurate (consider `pip freeze > requirements.txt`).
2.  **Prepare Interview Narrative (STAR Method):**
    * Refine the STAR method description (`secure_rag_star_narrative`) based on the completed project.
3.  **Code Cleanup & Refactoring (Optional):**
    * Review code for potential improvements in efficiency, readability, or error handling.

## Key Technologies Used

* Python
* LangChain (LCEL, Core components)
* `langchain-google-genai` (Gemini Embeddings & Chat Model)
* FAISS (Vector Store)
* `python-dotenv`
* Streamlit (UI)
* `google-generativeai` (for listing models)

## Notes / Assumptions

* Assumes the `.env` file exists in the project root and contains a valid `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
* The initial data (`docs.json`) and indexing script (`app/indexing.py`) were set up correctly.
* Fixes applied during development (model name, relative imports) are incorporated.
